## 2024-05-18 - Hover-Only Element Keyboard Accessibility
**Learning:** Hover-only elements (like the task 'Delete' button) with `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` are completely inaccessible to keyboard-only users as they cannot visually see where their focus is.
**Action:** Always pair `opacity-0` hover effects on interactive elements with `focus-visible:opacity-100` and clear focus rings (e.g., `focus-visible:ring-2`) to ensure keyboard users can discover and use the element.
